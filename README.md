# PullUps!

PullUps! is an app that allows the user to track their pull up progression, acting as a replacement for traditional paper based set and rep record keeping.

PullUps! is available for free on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rahimeen.soufin.pullups).

The user interface is based on material design guidelines and it utilizes Parse Clound Services as a back end to store devices and workout details of each user. Since Parse Cloud Services is scheduled to cease operations on January 28, 2017, the application will stop functioning on from that date onwards. A migration to Parse Server is not planned as of right now.
