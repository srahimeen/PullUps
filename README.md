##  PullUps!

PullUps! is an app that allows the user to track their pull up progression, acting as a replacement for traditional paper based set and rep record keeping.

PullUps! is available for free on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rahimeen.soufin.pullups).

The user interface is based on material design and it uses Parse Clound Services as a back end to store devices and workout details of each user.
